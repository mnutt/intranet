Description:
    The model_activeldap generator creates stubs for a new model.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and
    should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a test suite in test/unit, and test fixtures in
    test/fixtures/singular_name.yml. It will not create a migration.

Examples:
    ./script/generate model_activeldap user
    
        This will create a User model:
            Model:      app/models/user.rb
            Test:       test/unit/user_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/users.yml
