== INTRANET ==

Intranet aims to be a collection of utilities for small businesses to use to keep track of things internally.  Currently the most developed part of the application is a people directory that owes much of its code to the Caboose Facebook app.  Currently administration rights must be granted manually through the console.

Modify config/settings.yml if you have a google calendar you want to display.  Gems are frozen in vendor/, but you need to install FreeImage 3.93. (from macports, source, or your distro's package manager)

Intranet is licensed under the MIT license.  Portions are copyright Rick Olsen and other Caboose members.  Plugins in vendor/plugins may have their own licenses.
